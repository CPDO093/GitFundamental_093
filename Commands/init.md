# git init

the `git init` command is used to creata an empty repository.

if you wanted to creat a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following command:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[status](./status.md)
[add](./add.md)
[commit](./commit.md)
[push](./push.md)
and more.

Init will creat the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
